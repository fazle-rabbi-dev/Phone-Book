> [!Warning]
> When I created this app, I didn't have enough knowledge about clean code, the best folder structure, best practices. That's why the code for this project is not well-organized.

## 🔒 Privacy
> [!Important]
> When you create a new contact, the phone-number will be encrypted using your secret key. Therefore, your contact privacy is **100%**. *Even the developer of this app can't see your contact information!*

## 🔴 Unveiling the Journey of Building Phone-Book
> [!Note]
> After learning Next.js, I had a plan to create a phone book web app for storing phone numbers from my contacts. As I started working on it, I realized the potential to make it a multi-user platform. I added account creation and login functionalities, allowing anyone to store and access their phone numbers from anywhere. Completing this project was a significant achievement for me, especially after learning Next.js 13.
